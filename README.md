# Oliver-v6.1 - 6 DOF Articulated Robot
Purpose of this robot is to create a medium payload high accuracy, high torque articulated robot arm from scratch to aquire new skills further cement complex kinematics control.

Key upgrades from previous version:
- BLDC high torque motors
- High speed, high power motor drivers (ODrive)
- Fully closed loop control (position, velocity, and torque)
- Hard-stop homing routines (no sensors)
- All aluminum construction
- Brakes added to joint 2 & 3
- USB2.0 high speed communication
- Utilizing RoboDK for teaching and IK solving

Skill aquired from v6.1:
- CAD to CAM workflow
- CNC machining 
- Advanced multi-threading process (python)
- High speed passthrough position and velocity control
- True linear end effector trajectory (work in progress)
- Online target teaching
